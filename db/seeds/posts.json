You said yes but you were waiting for someone. I asked if you wanted to sit down. You said you were going to stand there till the herds came home. I told you it was cows. That was our conversation. Later I saw security talking to you. I should have known you were a kleptomaniac because you stole my heart within that short period of time. I wish I could see you again, but I think the aliens took you away.","_id":"533a6c2371c244593ef653e0","tempnames":[],"comments":[],"loc":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-122,47]},"author":"533713ee9ff74e373f4e74da"},

I got your name from your cup, you told me you work on 4th ave. I hope you don't have a boyfriend...if you do tell him how lucky he is...
